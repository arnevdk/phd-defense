## TODO:

* Backup slides for all reviewers based on review questions
* check dissertation for conclusions, limitations, recap (conclusion per topic)
* and perspectives

* Interpret graph before making statements about it
* 3. Instead of performing task, say mental task
* 6->7: need to account for these downsides in task and decoder design
* introduce contribuctions from research question, don't name BCI design
* Slide 14: make link with state of the art, currently cannot be decoded well
* 16: put takeaways on slide (lack of visual information hard to decode)
* 17 -> 18: absence of visual components is not the only problem
* 20->21: in order to evaluate our results, it is important to thes them with
  the target population


* Goal: assumptions:
   cognitive ability is kept
   able to perform the task

* First: cannot focus attention
  Second: algorithm cannot cope with jitter

* 18: show distractor ERP

* 20: remove bottom 2 plots, remove the average
* 29: recap: shorter, to the point, link to contributions
* Conclusions: highlight that we've reached our goals

* Flicker gif
* Remove bottom alignment plot
 Add main message: could all mobe eyes a little bit
  Explain decoders
  Explain graph
* Avoid gaze independent
* 18: Explain clusters ir drop
* 26: indicate eye tracker, laptop, eeg cap
* Never say gaze- independent, say independent of eye movements
* UCD schematic and reference

Questions from jury:
* Is it working or not
* Is it open
* add channel map in backup slide
* Go through questions in report, prepare 1 slide/answer for all their remarks
