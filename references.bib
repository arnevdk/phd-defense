  abstract  = {Many people affected by debilitating neuromuscular disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brainstem stroke or spinal cord injury are impaired in their ability to, or are even unable to, communicate. A brain–computer interface (BCI) uses brain signals, rather than muscles, to re-establish communication with the outside world. One particular BCI approach is the so-called ‘P300 matrix speller’ that was first described by Farwell and Donchin (1988 Electroencephalogr. Clin. Neurophysiol. 70 510–23). It has been widely assumed that this method does not depend on the ability to focus on the desired character, because it was thought that it relies primarily on the P300-evoked potential and minimally, if at all, on other EEG features such as the visual-evoked potential (VEP). This issue is highly relevant for the clinical application of this BCI method, because eye movements may be impaired or lost in the relevant user population. This study investigated the extent to which the performance in a ‘P300’ speller BCI depends on eye gaze. We evaluated the performance of 17 healthy subjects using a ‘P300’ matrix speller under two conditions. Under one condition (‘letter’), the subjects focused their eye gaze on the intended letter, while under the second condition (‘center’), the subjects focused their eye gaze on a fixation cross that was located in the center of the matrix. The results show that the performance of the ‘P300’ matrix speller in normal subjects depends in considerable measure on gaze direction. They thereby disprove a widespread assumption in BCI research, and suggest that this BCI might function more effectively for people who retain some eye-movement control. The applicability of these findings to people with severe neuromuscular disabilities (particularly in eye-movements) remains to be determined.},

  abstract  = {Background In a visual oddball paradigm, attention to
                   an event usually modulates the event-related
                   potential (ERP). An ERP-based brain-computer
                   interface (BCI) exploits this neural mechanism for
                   communication. Hitherto, it was unclear to what
                   extent the accuracy of such a BCI requires eye
                   movements (overt attention) or whether it is also
                   feasible for targets in the visual periphery (covert
                   attention). Also unclear was how the visual design of
                   the BCI can be improved to meet peculiarities of
                   peripheral vision such as low spatial acuity and
                   crowding. Method Healthy participants (N = 13)
                   performed a copy-spelling task wherein they had to
                   count target intensifications. EEG and eye movements
                   were recorded concurrently. First, (c)overt attention
                   was investigated by way of a target fixation
                   condition and a central fixation condition. In the
                   latter, participants had to fixate a dot in the
                   center of the screen and allocate their attention to
                   a target in the visual periphery. Second, the effect
                   of visual speller layout was investigated by
                   comparing the symbol Matrix to an ERP-based
                   Hex-o-Spell, a two-levels speller consisting of six
                   discs arranged on an invisible hexagon. Results We
                   assessed counting errors, ERP amplitudes, and offline
                   classification performance. There is an advantage
                   (i.e., less errors, larger ERP amplitude modulation,
                   better classification) of overt attention over covert
                   attention, and there is also an advantage of the
                   Hex-o-Spell over the Matrix. Using overt attention,
                   P1, N1, P2, N2, and P3 components are enhanced by
                   attention. Using covert attention, only N2 and P3 are
                   enhanced for both spellers, and N1 and P2 are
                   modulated when using the Hex-o-Spell but not when
                   using the Matrix. Consequently, classifiers rely
                   mainly on early evoked potentials in overt attention
                   and on later cognitive components in covert
                   attention. Conclusions Both overt and covert
                   attention can be used to drive an ERP-based BCI, but
                   performance is markedly lower for covert attention.
                   The Hex-o-Spell outperforms the Matrix, especially
                   when eye movements are not permitted, illustrating
                   that performance can be increased if one accounts for
                   peculiarities of peripheral vision.},

  abstract  = {Objective. Several ERP-based brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) that can be controlled even without eye movements (covert attention) have been recently proposed. However, when compared to similar systems based on overt attention, they displayed significantly lower accuracy. In the current interpretation, this is ascribed to the absence of the contribution of short-latency visual evoked potentials (VEPs) in the tasks performed in the covert attention modality. This study aims to investigate if this decrement (i) is fully explained by the lack of VEP contribution to the classification accuracy; (ii) correlates with lower temporal stability of the single-trial P300 potentials elicited in the covert attention modality. Approach. We evaluated the latency jitter of P300 evoked potentials in three BCI interfaces exploiting either overt or covert attention modalities in 20 healthy subjects. The effect of attention modality on the P300 jitter, and the relative contribution of VEPs and P300 jitter to the classification accuracy have been analyzed. Main results. The P300 jitter is higher when the BCI is controlled in covert attention. Classification accuracy negatively correlates with jitter. Even disregarding short-latency VEPs, overt-attention BCI yields better accuracy than covert. When the latency jitter is compensated offline, the difference between accuracies is not significant. Significance. The lower temporal stability of the P300 evoked potential generated during the tasks performed in covert attention modality should be regarded as the main contributing explanation of lower accuracy of covert-attention ERP-based BCIs.},
